# Dry-Bean-Classification
## Some Intro
 Dry bean classification is a crucial task in agricultural research and food production industries. The ability to accurately classify different types of dry beans is essential for quality control, yield optimization, and meeting consumer demands. Our aim is to develop a robust classification system using machine learning techniques to distinguish between various classes of dry beans based on their features.

The dataset utilized in this project contains a comprehensive set of features describing different attributes of dry beans, such as size, shape, color, and texture. 

This project not only serves as an exercise in machine learning but also has real-world implications for improving agricultural processes and meeting the growing global demand for high-quality food products.

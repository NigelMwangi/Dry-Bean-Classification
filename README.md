# Dry-Bean-Classification
## Overview
 Dry bean classification is a crucial task in agricultural research and food production industries. The ability to accurately classify different types of dry beans is essential for quality control, yield optimization, and meeting consumer demands. Our aim is to develop a robust classification system using machine learning techniques to distinguish between various classes of dry beans based on their features.

The dataset utilized in this project contains a comprehensive set of features describing different attributes of dry beans, such as size, shape, color, and texture. 

This project not only serves as an exercise in machine learning but also has real-world implications for improving agricultural processes and meeting the growing global demand for high-quality food products.
### Problem Statement
The <b> aim </b> of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable classification system for distinguishing between different types of dry beans based on their inherent characteristics. Despite the importance of dry bean classification in agricultural and food production industries, the task remains challenging due to the subtle variations in size, shape, color, and texture among different bean varieties.
